# Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy Using Statistical Learning

Status: In Progress

## Objective
To build a data-driven customer churn prediction system using statistical learning techniques and propose actionable retention strategies based on model insights.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and growth. The goal of this project is to identify customers at high risk of churn and understand the key factors contributing to churn behavior.

## Planned Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand churn patterns
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Feature engineering
- Baseline modeling using Logistic Regression
- Advanced modeling using tree-based methods
- Model evaluation with business-relevant metrics
- Formulation of data-driven retention strategies

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL

## Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key drivers of churn
- Comparison of statistical and machine learning models
- Insights to support customer retention decisions
